## 🚀 About Me

I'm a web developer with a creative eye, a technical mindset, and a drive to continuously improve. I specialize in front-end development and actively explore full-stack technologies, always aiming to build intuitive, responsive digital experiences.

My background includes both **structured training** and **self-directed learning**:

- 🎓 Completed a **Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp** (June–Nov 2024)
- 🎓 Earned an **Associate's Degree in IT (2018–2019)** with CCNA certifications in Routing & Switching and Network Security
- 🧱 Background in **LEGO building** and **photography** helped shape my attention to detail and spatial design

Even though I'm fluent in languages like **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and TypeScript**, I'm always pushing myself to broaden my knowledge, explore new tools, and deepen my understanding of web development.
